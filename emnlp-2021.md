# EMNLP


This is the set of papers that I found particularly useful while exploring the EMNLP
2021 papers the gave me insight into the main topics of interest in these batch
of submissions.

A very useful tool I found to search across various topics is The EMNLP search.

## NLP + KG ?= Commonsense

"This year, we finally have a sound framework and taxonomy of various KG+LM approaches! The authors define 3 big families: 1️⃣ no KG supervision, probing knowledge encoded in LM params with cloze-style prompts; 2️⃣ KG supervision with entities and IDs; 3️⃣ KG supervision with relation templates and surface forms." - M. Galkin
