# Requests for Projects

Inspired by YC's [*Request for Startups*](https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs/), here are a list of potential problems for students, researchers, engineers, businesses and competitions.

They could be realised as research, datasets, libraries, applications or products.

## Language

### Sentence segmentation
Deep-learning-based sentence segmentation / sentence splitting
This is key for the self-supervised pre-training of BERT etc.

### Language detection
Deep-learning-based language detection / language identification
The incumbent is Google Chrome's stats-based cld3 (and ports to Node and Python).
Facebook did this in 2017 with fastText (which had been already proposed in our community) but it is still not great.

### Charset detection
Deep-learning-based charset detection / encoding detection
The incumbent is Mozilla's chardet (and ports to Node and Python, like https://pypi.org/project/chardet/).
It is not great.

### For Armenian
Note that we generally discourage language-specific work that copies advances in English, and favor language-agnostic approaches.
