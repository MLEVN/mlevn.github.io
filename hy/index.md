# Tools and data for the Armenian language

### Progress compared to other languages

Eastern Armenian is typically between language 50 and 100 for the top companies which launch products in many languages.  Just like for many other languages, early technical challenges were often around encoding for non-ASCII characters, but Unicode has mostly solved that.

TODO: compare to English, Russian, Hebrew, Georgian

### Word embeddings

fastText has trained embeddings for the top few hundred languages, including Armenian, on 
[Wikipedia](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/blob/master/pretrained-vectors.md)
and 
[Common Crawl](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/blob/master/docs/crawl-vectors.md).

[Word Analogy Task](https://github.com/ispras-texterra/word-embeddings-eval-hy/blob/master/word_analogy_task_hy.txt) along with GloVe, fastText, SkipGram, CBOW [embeddings](https://github.com/ispras-texterra/word-embeddings-eval-hy/blob/master/README.md) pre-trained on Wikipedia + news articles + blog posts.
